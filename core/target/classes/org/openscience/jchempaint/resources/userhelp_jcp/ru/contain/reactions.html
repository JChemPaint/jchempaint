<h3> Creating Reactions</h3>
<p>There are two ways to draw reactions in JChempaint:
<ul><li>You can chose <img src="../../../small-bin/reactionArrow.gif"> and draw 
the reaction arrow. All molecules to the left of that arrow become reactants, 
everything to the right products and everything on the arrow catalysts in a new 
reaction. This illustration shows what is meant with "left", "right" and "on": 
<br></br><img src="../../../large-bin/reactionPositions.gif"><br>Note the whole 
drawing panel is divided in these three sectors and all molecules not already 
part of a reaction become part of the new reaction.</br></li>
<li>You can also declare components part of a new or existing reaction. So you 
first draw all reactants and products, 
best from left to right. Then right click on the first reactant, chose "Reaction
->Make Reactant in new reaction". Right click on any other reactant and chose 
"Reaction->Make Reactant in existing reaction". Right click on any product 
and chose "Product->Make Product in existing reaction". The reaction will then 
be rendered with + and arrows as appropriate. In this way, you can also add 
molecules to a reaction.</li></ul></p>
<p>If you want to layout the reaction 
cleanly, just do "Tools->Clean Up" - this will layout molecules straight from 
left to right.</p>
<p>You can have multiple reactions in one drawing, for this choose "Reaction->
Make Reactant/Product in New Reaction" once you drew your first reaction. If you 
then do "Reaction->Make Reactant/Product in Existing Reaction", you are asked to 
which reaction you want to add.</p>
