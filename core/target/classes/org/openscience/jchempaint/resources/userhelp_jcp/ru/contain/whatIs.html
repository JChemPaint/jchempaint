<h2>What is JChemPaint?</h2>
<p>
JChemPaint <a href="bibliography.html#KRA00">[KRA00]</a> is an editor for 2D
Molecular Structures, like this one here <span class="inlinemediaobject">
<img src="../../../small-bin/caffeine.gif">. JChemPaint is intended to be
complementary to JMol(<a href="http://www.openscience.org/jmol">
http://www.openscience.org/jmol</a>), a visualisation and analysis tool for
3D molecular structures, which is, like JChemPaint, developed by an
international team of open source programmers.

<td>In at least three aspects JChemPaint is different from other programs of
this sort:
<ol>
<li>
  JChemPaint is an open source program <a href="bibliography.html#OS">[OS]</a>.
  It is Free Software. </p>
  <p>We believe that scientific software, especially when its development was
  publicly funded, should be free. As the GNU
  (<a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org</a>) people put
   it: Free Software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the
   concept, you should think of 'free speech', not 'free beer.' ".</p>
  <p>Everyone can participate in the development of the program. Everyone can
  download and change the source code, provided that he makes the changes
  publicly available again, according to the GNU General Public License (GPL)
  or GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), depending on the classes
  which have been changed. </p>
  This ensures that the community can take advantage of any bugfix/enhancements
  made to the system.</p>
  <p>It also ensures that a scientist, who needs a standard piece of software
  like a structure editor as a helper application in her new program,
  does not have to reinvent the wheel over and over again because all the
  structure editors that have been written before are now propriety software.
  If there is a free structure editor, she can focus on the real science.</p>
<li>You can <a href="participate.html">participate in its development</a>.
<li>Since JChemPaint is written in Java it runs on any computing platform and
  operating system for which a Java Virtual Machine (of version >= 1.4) has
  been implemented (like Linux, Windows 95/98/NT/Me/XP, Solaris, AIX and others)
  .
<li>JChemPaint is avaiblable free of charge.

</ol>

JChemPaint in its currently release supports:
<ol>
<li>Drawing features to draw all common chemical structure, the most important ones being
    <ol>
      <li type="a">drawing of single, double and triple bonds
      <li type="a">drawing stereo bonds
      <li type="a">setting attributes of atoms, like charges, isotopes, valences
      <li type="a">deleting of bonds and atoms
      <li type="a">common ring templates and custom ring closures
    </ol>

<li>Loading and saving of structures in Chemical Markup Language (CML)
  <a href="bibliography.html#PMR99">[PMR99]</a>, [ WIL2001 ] and as MDL Molfiles and SDF files (Load only for
  the latter)<a href="bibliography.html#DAL92">[DAL92]</a>.
<li>Automated Structure Layout, also known as Structure Diagram Generation
  <a href="bibliography.html#HEL99">[HEL99]</a>, <a href="bibliography.html#BLE91">[BLE91]</a>.
<li>Pasting structures as SMILES strings from the clipboard.
<li>Saving bitmap pictures of the structures.
<li>Saving structures as Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG )
<li>Postscript printing.
