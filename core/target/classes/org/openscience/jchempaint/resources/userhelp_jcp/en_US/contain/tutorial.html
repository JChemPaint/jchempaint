<h1>  JChemPaint Basic Tutorial</h1>
<h3> General Usage</h3>
<p>The general idea is that while using JChemPaint, the program always is in a 
"drawing mode". This means that clicks somewhere on the panel will draw a certain 
chemical entity. Examples for "drawing modes" are "single bond" or "Carbon atom". 
Drawing modes can be changed by the buttons or via menus. In 
addition to changing the mode, choosing a button or a menu item do also changes 
the currently selected items (if any). Context menus (which appear right clicking 
on the panel) change the element (atom, bond) on which you clicked for the 
menu. Apart from these "mode changes", there are also some buttons/menu items, 
which do a one-off action, but have no mode. Examples are "Cut" or "Generate 
Smiles". Keeping this in mind, we now show you how to create a molecule.</p>
<p>Another thing you should keep in mind is that JChemPaint is a "chemically aware 
editor". This means that many things are not drawn, but assigned as properties 
and then drawn by JChemPaint. The advantage is that import/exports to chemical 
formats can be much richer, but the usage is sometimes not as straightforward 
as with "direct" drawing. An example is if you want to have a title (like a name) 
rendered next to a molecule: You do not draw a string on the canvas, but assign 
the title to the menu and this is then rendered. Another example are reactions, 
you do not draw an arrow, but declare molecules as products or reactants and 
an arrow is then drawn between them.</p>

<h3> Creating Molecules</h3>
<p>When JChemPaint has been started, you automatically get an empty document.
 In order to paint a structure the typical steps would be the following:
<ul><li>Often it is the best to start with rings. Using the ring templates in
the button bar (<img img src="../../../small-bin/triangle.gif">, <img img src="../../../small-bin/square.gif"> etc.) you can build the
ring structures of the molecule. Click on a ring button (you switched to "Draw 
x-membered ring mode") and then in the document. You can dock a ring to another ring by clicking
 on an existing ring (the docking atom or bond will be highlighted while hovering over it). If the molecule
has no rings, go to the next step.</li>
<li>The next step are typically the chains. Choose the
<img src="../../../small-bin/bond.gif"> button (your are in "single bond mode" then), click on the atom where the chain
starts and then on the last atom of the chain to enlarge it. There are several 
ways to draw bonds in this mode:
  <ul>
   <li>Directly click on an atom: A bond with default length will be drawn at a reasonable angle.</li>
   <li>Drag from an atom: A bond with default length will be drawn at the angle to drag to. This makes it possible to exactly control the direction.</li>
   <li>Drag from an atom to another atom: A bond will be drawn linking the two atoms. This 
   way, you can also link fragments or close rings (for example, if you want a 
   large ring which is not in the templates).</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>After this, you can add double/triple bonds by using
<img src="../../../small-bin/bond.gif"> again and clicking on the bonds to make
double, triplei or quadruple. Alternatively you can use the bond context menu (right click on a bond) 
to pick one of these bond orders by using the buttons <img src="../../../small-bin/doubleBond.gif">,<img src="../../../small-bin/tripleBond.gif"> or <img src="../../../small-bin/quadBond.gif">.<br>
You can use <img src="../../../small-bin/up_bond.gif"> and
<img src="../../../small-bin/down_bond.gif"> to make existing bonds wedge bonds or
you can draw wedge bonds directly by clicking on an existing atom. The "wedge bond 
mode" works same as the "single bond mode" with respect to dragging etc., just 
that the bonds created are wedges.</li>
<li>Finally the atoms need to be set. Either use one of the symbol buttons ("Element X mode") and
click on an atom to change it to this symbol. For single-letter elements, you can 
also just hit the key while an atom is highlighted. So to set all the Oxygens in your 
molecule, hover over the atoms one after the other and hit "O" each time. 
You can also use the periodic
table <img src="../../../small-bin/element.gif"> to choose an element. With
 <img src="../../../small-bin/plus_one.gif"> and
 <img src="../../../small-bin/min_one.gif"> you can change the charge.</li>
<li>If you want to have a title for your molecule right-click on any ator or bond, 
choose "Molecule Properties" and enter the title.</li>
</ul>

Obviously the mentioned steps are only a suggestion.
You can do them in any order. Have a look through the menus to see what is available 
or read the <a href="referenceGuide.html">Reference Guide</a>.</p>
